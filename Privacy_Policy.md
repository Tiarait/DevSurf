- DevSurf itself does **not set or track cookies explicitly**.  
- Third-party services or ad providers used in the app may also use cookies for analytics or advertising purposes.

These third parties may have limited access to information necessary to perform their tasks but are **obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes**.

## Security

We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting information. **However, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is 100% secure**, so absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to external sites. We are **not responsible** for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Users are advised to review the privacy policies of these sites.
